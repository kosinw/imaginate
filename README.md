# Imaginate

Imaginate is a collaborative animation platform which allows users to view and create animations, fork existing animations, and collaborate on other users' animations. Imaginate has a built-in editing tool allowing users to draw each frame of an animation without leaving the site. Users can then upvote animations they like best, and the top animations will show up on the Discover feed. Users can also search for animations and browse each user's created animations.

Currently deployed [here](https://imaginate0.herokuapp.com).
